## Notes for Future Development

### Hero/Navbar Positioning
The user mentioned configuring navbar position relative to hero (above/below). Current implementation:
- Navbar is always rendered first (above hero)
- Navbar is sticky by default
- Arrow buttons in Template Builder are for section ordering, not removal

**Recommendation**: If navbar positioning needs to be configurable:
1. Add `navbarPosition: 'above-hero' | 'below-hero'` to navbar config
2. Conditionally render navbar before or after hero section in Home.tsx
3. Add toggle in Template Builder under Navbar settings

### Background Options
The user asked about background options. Current implementation:
- Backgrounds use semantic color tokens (bg-background, bg-muted/30, etc.)
- Hero section supports custom background images via URL input
- Newsletter section supports custom background images

**Recommendation**: To add more background customization:
1. Add background color picker in Template Builder
2. Add gradient options (linear, radial)
3. Save as theme configuration
4. Apply via CSS custom properties

### Categories/Tags Functionality
User asked what categories will link to. Current implementation:
- Categories are placeholder buttons
- No routing configured yet

**Recommendation**: Categories should link to:
- Filtered blog/article pages: `/blog?category={categoryName}`
- Or dedicated category pages: `/category/{categorySlug}`
- Requires implementing category filtering in Blog.tsx
